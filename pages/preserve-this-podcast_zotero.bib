The best reporting on the aftermath in Ferguson was being produced by activists on Twitter, a notoriously ephemeral medium. Jules, then an archivist at the University of California, Riverside, had the impulse to start saving tweets, but wasn’t sure how. “That whole weekend, watching things unfold, I thought, ‘This is a really amazing historical moment; we should think about capturing it,’ but I was just talking to myself,” he says. The following week, attending a Society of American Archivists conference in Washington, D.C., he voiced his fears en route to drinks at the hotel bar. He caught the ear of Ed Summers, a developer who just so happened to be the author of a Twitter archiving tool—and who promptly programmed it to va­cuum up \#Ferguson tweets. Within two weeks, he had amassed more than 13 million.},

	url = {http://www.loc.gov/folklife/fieldwork/pdf/FolklifeandFieldwork2016forWeb.pdf},
	abstract = {When the first edition of Folklife and Fieldwork was published in 1979, our
readers had a difficult choice to make: the better audio quality offered by
a bulky reel-to-reel tape recorder or the convenience of the newfangled cassette
deck. With one of those two machines, plus a single-lens-reflex camera and a few
rolls of film, the 1979 fieldworker was equipped to document the world. Earlier
editions of this guide gave great advice regarding the handling and preservation
of these older forms of documentation. These tips are still relevant for some
archival collections, but not for most fieldwork. Born-digital documentation
requires a whole new set of practices—new ways of recording and new methods
of preservation.
Since the first edition appeared there has also been a surge of interest in
personal archiving. Preserving family history, genealogy, and community history
has never been more popular. Popular interviewing projects like the Veterans
History Project and StoryCorps are leading the way in a new era of oral history
collecting, and both of their collections are part of the American Folklife Center
archive. While this book prioritizes the documentation of folklife, by which we
mean traditional culture and heritage, the guidelines offered here for interviewing and documentation apply to a broad range of topics.
Folklife and Fieldwork has been redesigned to make it more user-friendly
and more chronological. In large part, the table of contents serves as a step-bystep checklist for designing and implementing a fieldwork project.
For more information on the questions raised in this manual, as well for
the latest discussions on specific technologies and techniques, please consult the
online version of Folklife and Fieldwork at www.loc.gov/folklife},

However, unlike traditional publications, continued availability of these online resources is not guaranteed. An automated survey was conducted to quantify the growth in Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) published to date in MEDLINE abstracts, their current availability and distribution by journal.

Results: Of 1630 unique URLs identified, formatting and/or spelling errors were detected within 201 (12\%) of them as published. After corrections were made, a survey revealed that ∼63\% of these URLs were consistently available, and another 19\% were available intermittently. The rate of failure was far worse for anonymous login to FTP sites, with only 12 of 33 sites (36\%) responding. This survey also shows that journals vary disproportionately in the number of web citations published, suggesting policy implementation among a few could have a profound impact overall. Out of the 306 journals with a URL published in an abstract, Bioinformatics published the most (12\% of total).

On June 1st 2004 I severely injured my spine in a swimming pool accident in Bahrain, that injury laid me up in the hospital their for 13 days. I was very lucky less than 3\% of the people that suffered the type of burst compression fracture of their L1 vertebrae ever walk again. I was happy to be able to motor out of the hospital on my own two feet. Little did I know that event would change my life in more ways than one!

I came back to Hawaii and was laid up for 6 weeks recovering, after convalescent leave it was time to go back to work. I was still active duty in the Navy and the Navy fully expected me to do the job they where paying me for. I knew if I was unable to perform my job I would be medically discharged, and that was the last thing I wanted to happen.},

	abstract = {Issue 200. Crazy, huh? Look, I've never held a proper job for more than nine months, and so it’s more a surprise to me than anyone else that I’ve sent out two hundred of these comically lengthy newsletters for a living. (And that doesn't even count all the Insider and emergency issues.) Running this thing is hard, hard work — there hasn’t been a second when I’m not thinking about the newsletter since the first issue went out way back in November 2014 — but it’s been a really rewarding experience, and the fact never escapes me that it’s a privilege to serve this readership every week. So thanks for being a reader, and to the Insider subscribers, thanks for helping to keep the lights on.

While we’re here: I made two media appearances last week where I had the opportunity to talk through bigger picture stuff: CNN’s Reliable Sources podcast with Brian Stelter, and The Colin McEnroe Show on Connecticut Public Radio.},
